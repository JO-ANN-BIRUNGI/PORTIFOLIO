## 📂 Main Projects  

### Forecasting Daily Air Temperature in Doho, Uganda  
*Machine Learning & Deep Learning for Climate Forecasting*  
- Compared **Random Forest and LSTM** models  
- Built temporal features (lag variables, rolling statistics, seasonal features)  
- LSTM achieved best performance (**R² = 0.898**)  
- Applications: agriculture planning, energy demand forecasting, disaster preparedness  

##🔹**Context**

**Problem**: Farmers, energy providers, and disaster management authorities in Uganda often face challenges due to unpredictable temperature fluctuations, affecting food security, energy demand, and community resilience.

**Dataset:** Historical weather records (2013–2016) containing daily air temperature, humidity, min/max temperatures, and station identifiers.

**Key Features:**

Lag variables (1–14 days)

Rolling statistics (7-day mean & std)

Seasonal/date-based features (month, day-of-year, weekday)

One-hot encoded station identifiers

By leveraging both sequential dependencies (captured by LSTM) and nonlinear relationships (captured by Random Forest), the models were evaluated on predictive accuracy and reliability.

##🔹**Contribution**

I designed and implemented the full workflow:

1. **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**

Handled missing/zero values

Automated column detection

Applied lagging and rolling features for temporal dependencies

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Visualized temperature distributions and seasonal variations

Identified strong negative correlation between temperature and humidity (-0.78)

Highlighted seasonal effects using multivariate plots

3.**Model Development**

Random Forest Regressor: baseline ML model capturing nonlinear feature interactions

LSTM: sequential deep learning model for capturing time dependencies



4. **Evaluation Metrics**

MSE, MAE, RMSE → error measurement

R² → explained variance

✅ LSTM consistently outperformed Random Forest, showing stronger ability to learn temporal and seasonal dependencies.

5. **Visualization & Insights**

**Residual analysis** → showed tighter error concentration around 0 for LSTM

**Error plots** → confirmed unbiased predictions and anomaly detection

**Feature importance (RF)** → highlighted humidity, lagged temperatures, and rolling means as critical drivers

##🔹**Change**

This project demonstrated that deep learning (LSTM) can significantly improve weather forecasting accuracy in climate-sensitive regions. The outcomes provide actionable benefits:

.🌾**Farmers** → Optimize irrigation and planting cycles

.⚡**Energy providers** → Plan demand & prevent outages during extremes

.🚨**Disaster management** → Anticipate heatwaves/cold spells with early warning systems

.🏙 **Urban planners** → Use seasonal patterns in infrastructure planning

.📊 **Policymakers** → Integrate forecasts into climate resilience strategies

🚀**Future Enhancements**

Extend models to predict rainfall, wind speed, and humidity

Apply spatial-temporal modeling across multiple weather stations

Build an ensemble model combining RF, LSTM, and FFN

Deploy as a real-time forecasting dashboard/API for stakeholders

Integrate with decision-support systems for agriculture & energy
